# NodeJS Websockets(socket.io) Mongodb together as Webservices
NodeJS, Websockets(socket.io), Mongodb for creating Webservices.

This project combines several techniques to provide very nice and scalable webservices based on websockets! 
The database implementation is MongoDB. And the backend is NodeJS.

In the future I will be supplying this as a free webservice, which can be used by anyone from anywhere!
